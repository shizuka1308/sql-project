We propose a movie information system that provides users with a comprehensive collection of movie data, including ratings, genres, actors, release year, and other relevant information. This system will enable users to search for and discover movies that meet their specific needs and preferences quickly and easily.




To load data into the tables from tab or comma-separated files, you can use the COPY command in SQL. Here's an example of how to load data from a CSV file:
COPY my_table FROM '/path/to/my_file.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, DELIMITER ',', HEADER true);

We have added all the 6 table in .csv format in our folder.
